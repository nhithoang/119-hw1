size is the number of elements in the input dataset for the pipeline,

===== Questions 6-10: Performance Comparison 1 =====

For our first performance comparison,
let's look at the cost of getting input from a file, vs. in an existing DataFrame.

6. We will use the same population dataset
that we used in lecture 3.

Load the data using load_input() given the file name.

- Make sure that you clean the data by removing
  continents and world data!
  (World data is listed under OWID_WRL)

Then, set up a simple pipeline that computes summary statistics
for the following:

- *Year over year increase* in population, per country

    (min, median, max, mean, and standard deviation)

How you should compute this:

- For each country, we need the maximum year and the minimum year
in the data. We should divide the population difference
over this time by the length of the time period.

- Make sure you throw out the cases where there is only one year
(if any).

- We should at this point have one data point per country.

- Finally, as your answer, return a list of the:
    min, median, max, mean, and standard deviation
  of the data.

Hints:
You can use the describe() function in Pandas to get these statistics.
You should be able to do something like
df.describe().loc["min"]["colum_name"]

to get a specific value from the describe() function.

You shouldn't use any for loops.
See if you can compute this using Pandas functions only.

Comment on the plots above!
How dramatic is the difference between the two pipelines?
Which differs more, throughput or latency?
What does this experiment show?

===== ANSWER Q10 BELOW =====
The fromvar pipelines are consistently faster and acheieve higher throuhghput than the baseline pipelines. Throughput also changes more than latency. The throuhgput for the fromvar pipelines is about 2-3x higher than the baseline ones while the latency difference is only a few milliseconds. The fromvar pipelines run faster since memory access is quicker than file reads.

Operations in Pandas use Numpy arrays and vectorization to enable

Comment on the results you got!

14a. Which pipelines is faster in terms of throughput?

===== ANSWER Q14a BELOW =====
The baseline pipelines are much faster in terms of throughput.
===== END OF Q14a ANSWER =====

14b. Which pipeline is faster in terms of latency?

===== ANSWER Q14b BELOW =====
The for-loop pipeline is slightly faster in latency, but the difference is small.
===== END OF Q14b ANSWER =====

14c. Do you notice any other interesting observations?
What does this experiment show?

===== ANSWER Q14c BELOW =====
One interesting I noticed is that the vectorized operations handled bigger datasets much more efficiently, while loops got slower as the data grows.
===== END OF Q14c ANSWER =====

===== Questions 15-17: Reflection Questions =====
15.

Take a look at all your pipelines above.
Which factor that we tested (file vs. variable, vectorized vs. for loop)
had the biggest impact on performance?

===== ANSWER Q15 BELOW =====
The vectorized vs. for-loop difference had the biggest impact on performance. Vectorized pipelines were way faster, while reading from a file vs. variable made only a small difference.
===== END OF Q15 ANSWER =====

16.
Based on all of your plots, form a hypothesis as to how throughput
varies with the size of the input dataset.

(Any hypothesis is OK as long as it is supported by your data!
This is an open ended question.)

===== ANSWER Q16 BELOW =====
As the dataset size increases, throughput also increases since larger batches make better use of system resources
===== END OF Q16 ANSWER =====

17.
Based on all of your plots, form a hypothesis as to how
throughput is related to latency.

(Any hypothesis is OK as long as it is supported by your data!
This is an open ended question.)

===== ANSWER Q17 BELOW =====
In general, higher throughput corresponds to lower latency for the same operation. Pipelines that can handle more data per second also tend to complete each task faster.

This part is optional.

Use your pipeline to compare something else!

Here are some ideas for what to try:
- the cost of random sampling vs. the cost of getting rows from the
  DataFrame manually
- the cost of cloning a DataFrame
- the cost of sorting a DataFrame prior to doing a computation
- the cost of using different encodings (like one-hot encoding)
  and encodings for null values
- the cost of querying via Pandas methods vs querying via SQL
  For this part: you would want to use something like
  pandasql that can run SQL queries on Pandas data frames. See:
  https://stackoverflow.com/a/45866311/2038713

As your answer to this part,
as before, return
a. the list of 6 throughputs
and
b. the list of 2 latencies.

and generate plots for each of these in the following files:
    output/part2-ec-a.png
    output/part2-ec-b.png
